# Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to create a code quiz, with coding questions that presented themselves one at a time, with a timer. The timer was supposed have time docked from it for every wrong answer, and there is a scoreboard at the end to add the user's initials, along with their high score(s). 

##### Disclaimer: I was only able to get most of the basic functionalities of the page working. I am missing additional styling, as well as functionality of the scoreboard.
